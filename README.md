Netflix clone built with React using compound components. All styling handled with Styled Components. Firebase used for back end user authentication. 

See deployed application here: https://netflixclone-dusky.vercel.app/browse

Notes:
- Different design patterns possible for building this UI, compound components is clean for integrating styled components and making testing seamless - never used before so wanted to tinker around with it. 
- All components exported as defaults in index.js phonebook in component folder.
